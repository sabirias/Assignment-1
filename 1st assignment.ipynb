    "\n",
    "ANS:- Python is a versatile programming language that supports various programming paradigms.\n",
    "      Here are some of the key programming paradigms that Python supports\n",
    "    \n",
    "      a) Imperative/Procedural Progamming:-Python allows you to write code in a procedural style,\n",
    "                                           where you define a series of steps for the computer to execute.\n",
    "            \n",
    "      b) Opject-Oriented Programming(OOP):- Python is designed to support object-oriented programming,\n",
    "                                            allowing you to create classes and objects, encapsulate data,\n",

    "                           variable explicitly. The interpreter determines the type during runtime.\n",
    "        \n",

    "                                 is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code. \n",

    "2. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):\n",
    "\n",
    "    if condition:\n",

    "        # Code block for false condition\n",
    "        print(\"Condition is false\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   Both the `if` and `else` blocks are defined by indentation.\n",

    "3. Loops (for, while):\n",
    "\n",
    "    for item in iterable:\n",
    "        # Code block for the loop\n",
    "        print(item)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Similarly, the indented block under the `for` statement is the suite of code that gets executed in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Class Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyClass:\n",
    "        # Code block for the class\n",
    "        def __init__(self, x):\n",
    "            self.x = x\n",
    "\n",
    "   The code block under `class MyClass:` defines the suite of code belonging to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Exception Handling (try, except):\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code block that may raise an exception\n",
    "        result = 10 / 0\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        # Code block for handling the exception\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   Both the `try` and `except` blocks are defined by indentation.\n",
    "\n",
